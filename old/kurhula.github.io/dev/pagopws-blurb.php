        Here are instructions on how to program your own pong game. After following these instructions
        successfully, you might want to check where you went wrong in your previous code or what you did
        better. Be free to improve on this game. As you will come to see, there is a lot of repeat code,
        more especially when you have to choose a new y value and when you have to decide who serves.
    </p>

    <p>
        First you need to understand the task you're trying to accomplish. You're asked to develop a game of
        pong that has two players playing against each other. There are no strict rules as to who serves and
        when; or even the number of points to reach the end of game.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now decide what sprites (objects) you will need to accomplish this task. They are a table or court
        where your players will be playing, your two players and your tennis ball.

    <img src="../img/scratch/player2.png" class="img-responsive" style="float: left">
    <br/><br/><br/><br/>

    <p>
        All these sprites can be drawn by selecting the “Paint new sprite” button on top of the Sprite List.
        Name your sprites as shown above.
