All the xUnit-style test automation libraries follow a common architecture. The following are the major components of the architecture:
- Test case class: This is the base class of all the test classes in the test modules. All the test classes are derived from here.
- Test fixtures: These are functions or methods that run before and after blocks of the test code execute.
- Assertions: These functions or methods are used to check the behavior of the component being tested. Most of the xUnit-style frameworks are packed with powerful assertion methods.
- Test suite: This is the collection or group of related tests that can be executed or scheduled to be executed together.
- Test runner: This is the program or block of code that runs the test suite.
- Test result formatter: This formats the test results to produce the output of test execution in various human readable formats like plaintext, HTML, and XML.
