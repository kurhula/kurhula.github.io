        It took me less than 2 weeks to clean the data that now forms part of the more than 10,000-word
        <a href="https://madyondza-cms-dictionary.herokuapp.com/" style="color: blue" target="_blank">
            online dictionary.
        </a>
        This is besides the work I had to do in scanning the hardcopy dictionary and then converting
        from PDF to text file. In comparison, the Second Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary contains
        around 231,000 words

            Oxford Dictionaries
        </a>], while the Urban Dictionary contains approximately
        <a href="http://www.infotoday.com/LinkUp/Urban-Dictionary-Six-Million-Words-You-Wont-Find-in-Websters-76779.shtml"
           style="color: blue" target="_blank">
            6 million
        </a> definitions and
        <a href="http://www.quora.com/How-many-entries-are-there-in-Urban-Dictionary" style="color: blue"
           target="_blank">
            2.1 million
        </a> unique words and phrases. It would be hard to know how many words in total exist in the
        Xitsonga language or for all African languages combined, but for an estimated 2,000 languages,
        there should be around a billion. In a way, 10,000 is an achievement, but still scratching the
        surface in terms of the possibilities that exist.
