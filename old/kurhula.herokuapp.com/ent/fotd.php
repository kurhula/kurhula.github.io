                <p class="date">Last updated on: June 18, 2010 by <a href="../index.php#about">Musa Kurhula Baloyi</a>
                </p>
                <br/>

                <p>
                    It began as the first online Tsonga (Tswa-Ronga) dictionary, bringing members words and names of
                    Tsonga origin, and including those adopted and/or adapted, and their translations in English. We
                    also doubled back (as we do now) from the English to the Tsonga.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Tonga, Thonga or Tsonga people and languages span most of southern Africa, notable countries being
                    South Africa, Swaziland, Mozambique, Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe. In these countries, there are
                    regions where one or more languages and/or dialects are more dominant. For example, in South Africa,
                    Tsonga people are mainly found in the Limpopo, Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng provinces, with
                    smaller populations in North-West and Free State. Within these provinces, there are towns and cities
                    where they are most prevalent, although this is continually changing in the new South Africa as
                    black people can now move freely. Most or all of southern Mozambique is inhabited by Tsonga people,
                    variously named as Copi, Rhonga, Ndzawu, Tonga, Shangana, and Tshwa. The provinces are Maputo,
                    Maputo City, Inhambane, Manica, Gaza, and Sofala.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We respect calls made by members. First, that we should speak in Xitsonga ONLY. Second, to refrain
                    from confusing Mutsonga/Vatsonga with Muchangana/Machangana. We address the first request by
                    declaring Tsonga Tuesdays, where we insist on speaking Xitsonga ONLY. On any other day, members are
                    free to use Tsonga or English as we seek to reach the widest audience, not just Vatsonga. Xitsonga a
                    hi xa Vatsonga ntsena. The second request is a bit tricky to fulfill. We'd like to preserve the fact
                    that Vatsonga and Machangana are one without imposing a Shangaan identity on Vatsonga. This can only
                    be enforced gradually as more and more people become aware of the differences. This submission has
                    been made by Nhlanganelo wo Hluvukisa Xitsonga and we acknowledge it. The story goes, interaction
                    with the Ngoni (Nguni), where the Ngoni married Tsonga women and assimilated some Tsonga men, gave
                    rise to the Shangaan, whom are sometimes confused to mean all Tsonga. This trend is apparent in
                    Zimbabwe, Mozambique, South Africa and Swaziland. The Ngoni group involved was the
                    Ndwandwe-Gaza-Nguni, who spoke Lala, now a dialect of Zulu. As an estimate, the Shangaan dialect is
                    over 95% Tsonga.

                <p>

                        and Tonga people.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                </p>

                </p>

                <p>
                    It has been said that the two dialects that unite all Tswa-Ronga languages are Nkuna and Khosa (HP
                    Junod, Matimu ya Vatsonga).
                </p>

                <p>
                    For "language of", the various languages and dialects may use one or more of the prefixes: Bi-,
                    Chi-, Ci-, Gi-, Ici-, Ki-, Ma-, Shee-, Shi-, Txi-, Va-, Wa-, and Xi-. For "people of", they use
                    either "Ba-" or "Va-".
                </p>

                <p>
                    Our objectives can be divided into four pillars: language, culture, history, and development. These
                    pillars culminate at building a library and museum of anything and everything Tsonga.
                </p>

                    Language: The Madyondza Online Dictionary. A hi dyondzeni Xitsonga. Let us all learn Xitsonga.
                    Learning somebody's language is another way of saying "I accept you as you are, you do not need to
                    speak foreign to be welcome." We're trying to help those who were born Tsonga but were defeated by
                    the System. If you're doing or you did English, Afrikaans, Sotho-Tswana or Nguni languages in
                    school, you can now study further; those who are not Tsonga to enjoy this beautiful language and
                    also be able to say "I am not ignorant!" It is known fact that the more you learn about others, the
                    more you learn about yourself; and those who are Tsonga to learn from each other and everyone and to
                    start thinking about things concerning their mother tongue. Now you have no excuse not to speak
                    Tsonga! But first, a few definitions...In addition, we look at and entertain questions about
                    proverbs (swivuriso), idioms (swivulavulelo) and riddles (mintshayilo). Tsonga Primers like the
                    Tsonga as a Foreign Language feature consistently look at Xitsonga simplistically. An example is the
                    Most Common Phrases note. Occasionally we do comparative studies within Tsonga and between Tsonga
                    and other African and European languages.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In Culture we share pictures of places and faces; promote, share and discuss music and lyrics; and
                    share music and other videos. An example of a song that we provided the lyrics for in both Xitsonga
                    and English is Mercy Tintswalo Mndlovu of Joyous Celebration's Hi Hanya Mahala. In History, we look
                    at past and current events. In Development we translate newspaper articles, offer a platform for
                    writers to share their works or works of art and distribute information. We also do translations of
                    important works the world over.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All these pillars are interconnected. In one way or another, they are inspired and informed by the
                    works done by the authors of
                <ol>

                </p>

                <p>
                    We are interested in working with any or all publishers (and similar or related) of Tsonga material
                    while still maintaining our autonomy. We welcome all contributions.
