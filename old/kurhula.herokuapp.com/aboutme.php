<p>My name is Musa Kurhula Baloyi. I was born in Malamulele, Limpopo, South Africa. 
I spend most of my time in Gauteng, South Africa, with my wife and son.</p>

<p>I went to school at Hlawulekani Primary School, Humula High School and Khatisa High School.
I then studied at the Universities of Limpopo, Witwatersrand, and Cape Town at the African 
Institute for Mathematical Sciences.</p>

<p>I have worked for the following companies: IBM, ThoughtWorks, Standard Bank and 
Differential Capital. I currently work with Brighter Futures Tuition on a part-time 
basis. I run a company called Madyondza Consulting, which I founded, specialising in 
multiple services.</p>

<p>My current aim is to consolidate all that I have learnt and studied, and fuse it 
with my passions to build the Madyondza brand and company. These passions are many, 
namely innovation, software development, competitive programming, enterpreneurship, 
writing, education, finance and the Xitsonga language.</p>
