        This article was supposed to be entitled “How Thulamela Underdeveloped Malamulele”, inspired by the
        book “How Europe Underdeveloped Africa” written by Walter Rodney. I came up this similar title
        because one, I am from Malamulele, and two, I have witnessed first-hand how an uncaring government
        can drive a community to extreme levels of poverty and with that self-destruction. I was hoping to
        look at all the projects that were done in Malamulele compared to the ones that were done in
        Thohoyandou, the dual seat of Thulamela Local Municipality and Vhembe District Municipality. I would
        look at the cost of each project as well as the status of completion. This would highlight the
        subtleties of the municipality's spending patterns.
