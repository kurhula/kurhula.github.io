        Social media networks have been around for a while and have changed the way individuals interact
        with their circles and beyond. However, we believe that Africa still has to create one social
        network that is going to address its needs, unlike conforming to an existing trend. There are many
        challenges to this, but in the same breath, many opportunities abound. We are going to go into the
        details of what these challenges are and also how a social media company can take advantage of the
        opportunities around the continent.
